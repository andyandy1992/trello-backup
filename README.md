Trello Backup
=============

This app backs up your Trello boards as JSON files to a local directory. You can find the original repository that I forked [here](https://github.com/smartystreets/trello-backup).

Setup
-----
- Make a copy of OR rename the `trello-backup.config.sample` file to `trello-backup.config`.
- Add your Trello API Key and Token to `trello-backup.config` (can also generate them from `trello-backup.py`), and edit the other configurations as required.
- Run `trello-backup.py` to perform backup.
